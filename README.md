an eventcmd script for mcabber.

Vicki adds a few nice things to mcabber private messages and group chat:

* Integrate growl notifications
    - sticky URLs if someone shares a URL
* Fires off an email to you based on key words
* Responds contextually based on what's being said (you know: for humor)
