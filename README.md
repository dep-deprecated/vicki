Vicki adds a few nice things to mcabber private messages and group chat:

* Integrate growl notifications (via gntp)
    - sticky, clickable growl windows if someone shares a URL
* Fires off an email to you based on certain events, key words
* A synthesized voice will speak to you based on what's being said (you know: for humor)
