an eventcmd script for mcabber.

Vicky adds a few nice things to mcabber private messages and group chat:

# Integrate growl notifications
    - sticky URLs if someone shares a URL
# Fires off an email to you based on key words
# Responds contextually based on what's being said (you know: for humor)
